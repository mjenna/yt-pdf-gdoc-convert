90.925: CONNECT! Hello, we are ENHYPEN!
93.279: [(Because it is our first time seeing each other, everything is unfamiliar)]
Yes.
95.617: Greeting just by two of us.
97.387: - It is really awkward.
- Really?
99.185: Today.
100.171: [How would the performance kings be?]
I am actually looking forward to today.
102.064: Are you looking forward to today's lesson too?

104.079: We have our excited heart.
105.079: [Chorus]
- I couldn't sleep well last night.
- I came without sleeping.
106.494: [(The leader and the baby couldn't sleep last night)]
It was at five o'clock.
108.141: - I think you are lying.
- Really.
110.289: Because I was told that I was meeting ENHYPEN.
112.002: I came dressed like XO's outfit.
114.218: [#Casual #Boyfriend look]
- Does it look alike?
- It is quite similar.
115.141: [Am I Bada Lee or ENHYPEN?]
I think you have some vibes.
118.236: Okay, okay.
118.848: [Today's practice room is a bit unfamiliar]
It's my first time being in this practice room.
120.387: [ENHYPEN's original practice room]
Our practice room is on the third floor.
123.618: But the air conditioner is broken.
125.787: [(Exclusive News) HYBE's air conditioner is broken]
HYBE's air conditioner might be broken.
128.002: - Please fix it.
- Please fix it.
130.14: - Actually we have never worked together.
- That is right.
132.818: - But you have done the Smoke challenge.
- That is right.
135.387: - Did you watch it?
- Of course!
137.478: [It turns out Bada Lee is an engine]
- I watch everything.
- Oh my gosh.
139.018: In order for us to get closer.
140.679: Could we start with Smoke challenge?
142.479: [No music version]
Could we do it with just counts.
144.618: [Starting to get closer right away]
148.909: [What is this perfect harmony all of the sudden?]
151.155: [(Huh?)]
155.848: That is right.
157.08: [(Actually it was HEESEUNG's first Smoke challenge)]
You know it all.
158.141: But
159.203: I watched the video.
161.464: [He memorized it as he saw on the video]
So it goes backwards because you memorize it as you watched.
164.633: [The all-rounder center can dance either way]
- I memorized it as I saw it.
- That is okay.
166.772: Then.
167.68: Let's talk sitting down, shall we?
168.895: [Shall we get closer?]
- That is good.
- Okay, I will sit down.
172.109: Oh my gosh.
173.126: If you come to Practice Rooms Bada Lee,
175.218: you have to tell us what is must-have item in your practice room.
176.864: [It is time to introduce must-have item in practice room!]
They really introduce us really must-have items.
179.403: I must bring this!
180.744: Do you guys have that kind of items?
181.511: [# HEESEUNG's must-have item / Perfume]
- Mine is perfume.
- Perfume.
183.926: Originally, after practicing, even though I sweat a lot,
187.88: I couldn't feel that it was uncomfortable.
189.895: But when I am going home after it is all finished,
191.68: I feel a bit icky.
193.049: When I'm not feeling so good,
194.511: I try to use the perfume
197.403: and I try to hide it and then take a shower.
200.603: [Found another perfume friend]
I also carry around perfume a lot.
202.757: [Always / Before practice]
I always spray it before practice.
204.68: [During practice / (Totally agree)]
- I spray it during practice.
- That is right.
206.511: That way it is a bit.
207.834: [She seeks for fragrant practice]
I can practice a lot fragrantly.
210.188: For me,
211.295: [# NI-KI's must-have item / Cap]
it's a cap.
212.695: [(That is so pretty)]
214.357: It took about four months for this to arrive.
216.71: [(It was customized in the U.S.A)]
I had it customized in the United States.
218.942: [No wonder why it was perfect for NI-KI]
It is a customized cap.
220.526: It is really precious.
221.726: - I always use it when I am practicing.
- Always.
223.111: My hair is a bit long,
224.649: - so it's very uncomfortable.
- You just brush your hair back and put it on right away.
226.511: [Hip-hop Ping must have a cap]
I also love hip-hop dance.
229.48: It might be your first time seeing this.
231.142: [(Slide)]
Do you know what this is?
232.203: What is this?
232.926: [(Checking)]
It is iced tea.
233.926: [# HEESEUNG's must have item / Iced tea]
- Really?
- I always drink it whenever I practice.
237.141: Is it peach iced tea or lemon iced tea?
239.203: - It is peach.
- It is peach.
240.557: Really, I went to all the places around this company.
242.05: I think I tried all of their iced tea.
243.25: [(Iced tea sommelier)]
244.265: [They take turns in perfect harmony]
246.182: It's a hoodie.
246.88: [# NI-KI's must have item / Hoodie]
This hoodie is really.
248.788: Do you like hoodies?
249.773: I can't dance if I am not wearing a hoodie.
251.096: [(Hard line team hoodie)]
Really?
252.373: I buy three or four hoodies of the same design.
254.604: And I would rotate them.
255.327: [Hip-hop Ping's combination: Cap and hoodie]
Wearing a hat and a hoodie.
257.464: [The thing that everyone knows]
Then, do you have more must-have items?
259.233: - That is it.
- That is it? Really?
261.188: There must be something else.
262.004: [(Got it)]
263.172: [They put the profile in softly]
264.358: [Let's go see performance kings' profile!]
Thank you!
267.049: I spray it like this.
268.511: Then we got our practice room profile.
270.973: So we will take a look at the profile.
272.111: [Let's get the engine started]
We will take time to figure out.
274.419: HEESEUNG's practice room profile.
276.835: [Q. What is your practice room name?]
His practice room name.
278.619: It is SUPREME HEESEUNG.
281.573: Since elementary school,
284.096: I haven't heard this word.
285.158: - The ZI.
- That is right.
287.004: [ZI SUPREME HEESEUNG]
- I am ZI SUPREME HEESEUNG.
- That is right.
289.096: I also like popping.
290.896: [You can't leave Y2K out of popping]
It is a bit Y2K vibe.
292.666: I heard about this.
294.066: HEESEUNG originally
295.066: couldn't dance well.
296.266: [(Our ZI SUPREME HEESEUNG did?)]
I heard, at first.
297.45: When I came here at first as a trainee,
299.112: I have never danced before.
300.681: So I had a bad habit.
301.912: I was very flexible and things.
303.773: So they said I looked like a squid.
304.712: [I don't agree at all]
305.604: To the point where I would get teased...
307.343: So I got stimulated by those things a lot.
310.85: [The legendary trainee that stimulates everyone]
There was YEONJOON from TXT.
313.804: [ZI SUPREME HEESEUNG needs stimulation to grow]
I got stimulated and since then,
316.527: I practiced a lot.
317.926: [(Proud)]
- He was a good stimulation.
- Yes.
319.604: Is he really the legendary trainee?
321.712: Yes, he is.
322.359: Then the next generation was me.
323.989: - Wow.
- That's right. From what I heard,
325.697: there is YEONJOON
326.835: among the Big Hit trainees,
327.82: but there is also HEESEUNG.
330.174: That is right.
331.942: [(Thank you)]
334.173: [Q. What was your first dance in your life?]
Then what was your first dance in your life?
337.066: He really wrote his first dance in his life.
339.897: The dance when I was in kindergarten.
343.051: I had curly hair.
345.097: I wore an outfit like disco.
347.989: [Move / Move]
350.05: We were doing some moves like this.
351.774: They said I used to be really good back then.
352.943: [His dance moves were different ever since he was young]
I was one of the most talented.
355.297: - You had a lot of talent.
- Yeah talent...
357.276: Well then
358.86: is there a really unforgettable
360.897: dance choreography that you still remember?
361.774: [It's probably our debut song...]
I remember our debut song.
363.451: Liar.
365.204: [They're preparing for their tour]
We practiced our debut song, which we hadn't performed in a long time.
367.543: Nobody could remember the dance.
369.181: - There's a plot twist.
- We're doing well so far, why are you doing that?
372.635: [Q. My special dance point]
My special dance move is
374.99: dancing along with my hair.
376.682: Kind of...
378.313: How shall I say it?
379.421: Dancing together with it?
380.882: - Like this?
- For example,
382.051: we have a dance move for our song 'Fatal Trouble'.
386.297: [Swish...]
Like this.
387.221: [(His hair really dances along with him...)]
It's this kind of feeling.
390.204: You really dance with your hair!
391.82: [Impressed]
Like this and kind of like this.
394.713: [That’s HEESEUNG’s dance point!]
That's the special dance point!
395.867: [Undeniably HEESEUNG's move]
- HEESEUNG's.
- Point.
397.744: It's your point.
399.163: Next.
400.144: This is information about Ni-ki.
402.467: [(Born in 2005)]
It's kind of like Y2K over here.
404.498: [Before filming, filling out his information]
Nickname for practice room.
406.052: What is there?
407.113: [Asking SUNOO for help]
To SUNOO.
408.467: [(He answered)]
Hello?
409.836: I have to make a nickname.
411.498: Hm... (serious)
412.759: You're helping me.
414.144: Then how about...
415.467: [With SUNOO's vibes...]
Something like Dance Machine or Choreography Genius.
418.19: [Q. What's your nickname during practice?]
- You said Dance Machine.
- Dance Machine.
419.775: It seems like you dance like a machine.
422.691: [Story about NI-KI being a dance machine]
When I practice dancing,
424.394: there are times when we need to dance in the opposite direction, right?
425.959: [Teacher : You dance the opposite way and show them]
'You turn around and teach the other members the dance moves.'
428.298: Like this
429.236: I am told to do this.
430.513: [(Input) / (Output)]
The information is received quickly.
432.283: You dance right away.
433.678: [Q. Dance experience]
You have been dancing
435.56: since you were 3 years old.
438.129: My parents really loved Michael Jackson.
441.39: I saw the 'Thriller' music video.
444.021: [Michael Jackson Junior was born]
I fell in love with Michael Jackson.
446.559: [Q. First dance ever]
So 'Billie Jean' was your first dance ever.
448.852: It was Michael Jackson's 'Billie Jean'.
450.944: Wow it's really on another level.
452.883: While HEESEUNG was doing this
454.16: disco disco dance,
455.852: [They have quite different first dances]
you danced 'Billie Jean'.
457.267: [Q. My special dance point]
Then my special dance move is
460.175: utilizing my neck.
461.929: It's similar to HEESEUNG.
463.628: When I perform in our concert,
465.006: the end is so different from the beginning.
466.606: [Starts with slicked back hair]
When I slick my hair back,
467.637: [Ends with bangs]
I end up with bangs covering my forehead.
469.175: Since I use my neck too much,
471.76: [The product of using his neck too well]
my hair gets messed up.
472.883: Have you ever sprained your neck while dancing?
474.734: - No, it's surprising that it hasn't happened.
- Really?
477.406: So my neck is really thick.
479.191: It’s something you're born with.
479.837: Is it all muscles here?
480.945: And when I buy necklaces,
482.898: they become chokers.
484.237: [He has some concerns]
Since my neck is so thick.
486.468: [My favorite choreography]
My favorite choreography that I made.
489.467: 'HUMBLE' by Artist of the Month.
492.114: How was it while you were preparing for this?
493.729: While I was preparing, since I was
495.191: - representing ENHYPEN,
- Exactly.
497.037: [NI-KI missed his members]
I felt a lot of pressure.
499.099: But I think it was really fun.
501.222: NI-KI's image as a part of ENHYPEN
503.567: and NI-KI's image as an individual was completely
505.745: [Experienced a new version of NI-KI]
separate, so I was able to have a lot of fun while doing it.
508.36: [Speaking of ENHYPEN]
I heard that all seven of you dance well.
511.222: I really like that dance move.
512.405: [Tick! Tick!]
This one.
513.222: 'Pass the MIC.'
514.76: [Bada Lee's favorite is 'Future Perfect']
- 'Future Perfect'
- Yes, and I even
516.929: saved it offline and
518.006: watched it over and over on the airplane.
519.807: [(Bada Lee...) / (Our dance...?)]
I was like, 'How do they do those dance moves?'
522.975: I studied it a lot.
524.222: [Feeling dizzy so please perform together]
You watched a lot of our performances.
525.884: [Q. The hardest dance]
Then what was the hardest dance?
528.776: One of the first songs, performing cute songs
531.776: was the most difficult.
533.391: [Allergic to cuteness]
I also can't do cutesy things.
534.976: [HEESEUNG's thoughts = our thoughts]
Shouldn't we ask him to do it here?
536.376: But even after several years, it's still so difficult.
538.253: [(So excited )] / (Taken aback)]
Really...
539.761: [Doing good things together]
541.238: [NI-KI's pick for the most difficult - 10 Months]
545.237: [He grew up pretty reliable...]
547.607: [He grew up so well]
553.144: [This video is dedicated to ENGENE...]
556.991: [You all are now]
559.145: Watching the most difficult choreography
560.807: of ENHYPEN.
566.421: Well
567.812: - you two have practiced together for a long time.
- Right.
570.146: Could you rate each other's dance?
572.592: I think NI-KI's greatest strength is that.
575.346: [Even though he didn't put in maximum effort]
Even though he didn't put in all his power,
578.561: [NI-KI's skills / looks like he's using all of his strength!]
he looks very powerful.
580.238: And he's groovy.
581.469: [I think it really stands out in swaggy songs]
He is able to show this through songs that have swag.
585.345: [NI-KI's hip form is praised]
He is like that when performing those songs.
586.869: Now if you could rate HEESEUNG's dance?
589.192: I feel this during concerts.
590.807: [He is able to express his own feelings so well]
He is able to express his own style so well.
594.407: So HEESEUNG seems
597.346: to have his own genre.
598.361: [Praising HEESEUNG's own genre]
So I envy that about him.
602.223: Where did you learn how to talk like that?
603.607: [Warmth between the oldest and youngest]
I’m really serious, seriously.
606.207: [(Extremely touched)]
Touched.
607.331: HEESEUNG and NI-KI both
609.069: seem to have strong personalities.
610.238: Both of you have positive energy and spread it.
613.454: [(High-five) / (Clap clap clap...l]
Then.
615.592: [Sometimes separately... but also together]
618.946: So now that we have information about you,
621.35: shall we start our lesson?
623.085: [HEESEUNG, NI-KI and Bada Lee together]
- Okay.
- Okay!
624.592: [Excited for it!]
Let's go.
628.022: [Shall we officially start the class?]
Shall we officially start the class?
630.1: - Okay, let's go.
- Okay!
632.069: ENHYPEN's
633.362: [Congrats to ENHYPEN's comeback]
new song is coming out.
636.439: [(plz introduce the song)]
Please introduce it.
638.3: [2nd Full album repackaged 'ROMANCE: UNTOLD-daydream- / title song 'No Doubt']
The song 'No Doubt' is
640.777: [Undoubtedly ENHYPEN's dark pure love story...]
about undoubted love for the other person.
644.316: There's a lot of interesting moves in the dance.
646.239: - There's an old school feel to it.
- Old school.
648.808: [Clearly ENHYPEN]
650.377: Shall we learn the challenge?
651.531: [This challenge is necessary]
Do you have back pockets?
653.1: Um...ye...yes...
654.331: [(Buffering) / (found it)]
I do.
656.545: [I have, but it's a bit lower]
They're a little lower.
658.745: This time it's
660.07: [Special dance move using the pockets]
the special move.
662.054: [NI-KI's class starts]
Five, six, seven
663.623: [step 1. Put hand in your pocket and move head to the right]
eight and do this with your head this way.
667.977: - Two...
- Two.
669.485: Three and four.
670.931: [(Oh yeah...)]

- Just do it like that.
672.9: [This is the time to flaunt your looks]
Five, six, seven and move your head
676.099: -eight, end.
- End.
677.546: [step 2. Move your knees and roll your shoulders]
Two, three, and four and roll.
682.039: It's kind of like feeling.
682.962: Feeling, feeling.
684.731: - It's good.
- That's right.
685.393: [step 3. from the left, look straight and organize then whistle]
- At five, this way.
- Five.
687.347: Six, seven, eight.
689.839: - Eight.
- With a whistle.
690.848: [It means to rest one beat]
One, eat it,
692.178: [Detailed lesson per each beat by NI-KI]
two, three, and four and
698.131: five.
700.1: [(NI-KI is a master of details)]
Five, six, seven, and eight.
705.593: [(Hmm...)]
707.424: Is it right? (Checking)
