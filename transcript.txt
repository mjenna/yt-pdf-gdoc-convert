8.494: Hello, everyone.
10.149: It's Bada.
11.13: [An unfamiliar place...?]
This is my
13.395: [(Congrats) Bada's first independance]
new home!
16.218: Since I started living on my own for the first time
18.106: I was thinking about what new content I can show you
19.488: and I came up with cooking which I always wanted to show you!
21.708: I wanted to do a cooking vlog
23.413: so today,
25.122: [Various ingredients are ready]
I'm going to cook some delicious food.
27.606: But the PDs
29.056: [(A little upset)]
don't trust my cooking.
32.25: [(We've only seen Bada dancing...)]
So I will prepare some feast
34.883: to win over their hearts.
37.929: [That's why team Bada was invited without a notice...]
40.661: [Confirming Bada's cooking starts]
43.03: Today's menu is
44.375: doenjang jjigae, omelet rice, and spring onion kimchi.
47.761: When I in fourth grade,
49.512: I wanted to cook for myself
51.588: [(Bada in elementary school)]
so I was like 'Mom, how do I make Doenjangjjigae?'
54.327: So I made my first doenjang jjigae
56.231: in fourth grade.
57.324: So, to bring back those memories,
59.658: I'll be cooking doenjang jjigae!
61.22: [(First time cooking in new home)]
This is my first time in this new home
63.485: so I'm not sure if I'll be able to show off my skills
65.22: [Let's cook]
but I'll try my best.
68.182: [Before cooking, wash your hands]
71.072: Let me slice up some ingredients.
73.249: [(Get away...)]
75.181: I like to have mushrooms
77.074: [(Enoki mushrooms)]
in doenjang jjigae.
79.944: I even bought this to cook.
81.109: [Purchased organizing bowl for a tidy cooking experience]
84.778: This is enoki mushroom
86.591: [(Removing only the stem of the mushroom)]
and it's really good.
89.13: My mother would always put this
90.965: when she was cooking jjigae.
92.552: [(A lot of good food)]
And it was so good.
93.89: Let's just cute them in bite-sized pieces.
95.978: You're good at cutting.
97.606: It's a little...
98.894: showing off.

106.414: Let me boil the water.
108.25: [(Measuring by intuition)]
Let's pour water as much as I want
111.963: and let me put in the mushroom first.
116.133: You will fall in love with this mushroom.
117.965: It's really good.
119.472: (Whispers) Enpine mushrooms?
120.756: (Whispers) Enleki mushrooms!
121.668: Enoki!
122.549: [(Aha...)]
123.682: [(Can tell by just looking) / The pot is too small compared to the prepared ingredients)]
I think the pot is too small.
126.03: [(Changing the pot)]
I think it'll boil in no time
128.377: so I'll put everything in.
130.816: [You look like a cook...]
133.176: Cooking Queen Bada Lee Content.
136.284: On my way here,
137.697: I watched PAIK JONG WON YouTube
141.065: [Mr. Paik's tip: Cook doenjang jjigae with traditional doenjang!]
and he said traditional doenjang is better
142.36: when cooking doenjang jjigae.
143.335: So I bought some traditional doenjang.
145.379: Put this doenjang...
146.349: [(A spoonful by intuition)]
147.577: It should be by intuition.
151.534: I'll put some more of chili powder.
154.671: Do you think you'll cook often living alone?
157.284: My mother said that
159.339: once you buy the ingredients, you must use it up.
162.25: You must consume all the ingredients.
163.717: You must!
164.84: That's kind of like
167.54: [All the remaining ingredients from today will be used up]
the mindset of our household.
169.593: [All the ingredients were cooked in hygienic environment]
You can go in as well.
170.934: [(Finely chopped chili peppers)]
173.049: [(Cut the tofu into bite-sized pieces)]
177.198: Wait, time.
178.532: Look how perfect this is.
179.604: [Very evenly cut]
181.486: And then...
182.633: [(Proud)]
They're very even, aren't they?
184.02: It's gotten
185.015: [It went a little bit off]
a little smaller now.
187.096: But it's okay.
188.014: [(Dive in tofus)]
This is scary.
190.201: Every time I put something in, I'm like
191.673: [Making a fuss]
193.122: [Soup cooking essentials]
I do this every time.
194.496: Jjigae taste better the longer they simmer.
196.181: Let's let them simmer
199.011: while I make omelet rice.
201.393: [(The tip for omelet rice, the kimbap ham)]
This is ham for kimbap, everybody.
202.843: It's all cut
204.127: and you cut just cut them horizontally.
205.739: [Differs depending on the product...]
They're stuck together.
207.879: What I was afraid of when starting the cooking content
210.639: is that there are a lot of people who are good at cooking.
212.956: So I was worried to get scolded.
214.522: 'You can't cook that way!'
215.628: I was afraid of that
217.014: but everyone
218.267: has their own styles of cooking.
220.272: [(Chopping)]
221.616: [Going the Bada style...!]
I'll cook in my own style.
225.28: [(Adding the shrimps)]

228.525: The most important thing is to beat the eggs in advance.
231.955: Can you open the eggs with only one hand?
234.078: [Trying]
236.731: How do I do it.
237.863: [(Wrong)]
239.778: I've got all the eggshells in here.
242.373: I'll just do this.

271.586: I'm worried mostly about the house chores.
274.08: When I live with my family, we can share the work
276.902: but now I have to do them all by myself.
278.956: [Every person living alone will relate...]
House chores are the hardest to do.
281.075: [(Adding salt) / (Adding a handful of shrimps)]
283.501: [(Almost a 100k YouTuber)]
Have you ever thought about the nickname for your subscribers?
289.378: I want to do something special.
291.392: How about river?
292.685: River?
293.888: Rivers come together to make a sea (Bada).

317.812: [Bada's tip: Keep the oil and sausages on one side to grill]
it won't burn and it'll grill on the sides as well.
320.564: [(Grilled very well)]
They are well cooked.
322.365: [Last hurdle, frying the egg]
I'll fry the egg now.
328.535: Actually,
330.152: I wanted to do the tornado omelet or something like that.
332.849: [(Burdened)]
But instead, I'll be a little calm
335.051: and do what I'm
336.145: used to do.
337.277: When it's about this much cooked,
339.059: I'll put the stir-fried rice in.
342.221: You need to film this well!
346.652: [Perfect]
348.897: [Hexagonal person BADA LEE]

370.532: This is the vibe I'm looking for.
372.696: Hexagonal!
373.913: Lastly, I'll try the spring onion kimchi.
376.807: [(Cutting through the middle of the spring onion)]
I have to cut through the middle like this.
379.027: [(Cutting them bite-sized)]
380.967: A spoonful of crushed garlic.
383.127: [Soy sauce 2 : Anchovy Sauce 1 : Enough Sugar]
385.421: Put some soy sauce in.
386.856: At my home, it's easier to make this
389.56: [(Enough chili powder)]
because my mom always keeps the kimchi sauce ready made.
392.755: [Cooking Queen of the day, BADA's sauce / Her house doesn't have mom's sauce]
I can just use that.
395.105: [(Checking the taste)]
399.854: [Missing the taste of mother]
The secret to kimchi was my mom's sauce.
402.776: It's not that bad to eat though.

- But it's spicy.
453.236: [(Barging in chopsticks)]
454.214: Chili powder and spring onions are meant to be spicy.
456.912: It's like a little refresh.

0.0: [Bada Vlog]
7.489: Great job, everyone!
9.189: Bye.
9.839: [Bada!]
Hello, everyone!
11.254: Today.
12.181: Where am I on a business trip?
14.858: I'm here in Fukuoka for work!
16.772: For 'PROJECT 7,' which will be performing at the 'GOLDEN DISC AWARDS.'
20.069: Our 'CLOSE YOUR EYES' team, who officially made their debut!
23.207: They're performing the choreography I created
27.872: at the 'GOLDEN DISC AWARDS' this time,
30.561: so I'm here to direct their stage.
32.266: I helped with rehearsals, monitored their performance, and gave feedback.
35.722: After handling a few things,
37.465: I just got back to my hotel.
40.002: Coming as a director...
42.5: Is this my first time directing abroad?
44.339: I've done it so many times in Korea,
48.061: but I'm still a bit nervous
49.792: and doing my best with a strong sense of responsibility.
55.487: [What’s in My Bag, Business Trip.ver]
Shall I organize my bag a bit?
57.976: [The perfume I bought this time!]
First, I bought a perfume.
60.245: New perfume.
61.796: [My number one must-have item]
I forgot to bring my perfume.
64.038: So I got this pebble-shaped perfume.
65.66: [PUMKINI by Tamburins]
This is the scent I got.
67.97: [Describing the scent]
71.237: I used to only use solid perfumes,
73.246: but I wanted something more portable,
76.18: so I got this one.
77.634: Since it’s a scent I’ve used before,
79.326: of course, it smells amazing.
80.783: Here's how I apply my perfume.
82.089: [1. Spray all over the body]
I spray it like this, quick spritzes all over.
87.1: [2. Spray on the wrists]
Then, I spray it on my wrists.
89.245: [3. Use the remaining scent on the back of my hands]
I rub my wrists together and spread the scent onto the back of my hands.
93.018: [4. Lightly spray on clothes]
Then, I do a quick spritz on my clothes.
96.94: And that’s about it.
98.574: But my signature move when applying perfume is...
100.187: Spritzing generously
101.775: and always spraying
103.171: [(Right here!)]
on the back of my neck.
103.738: When it gets hot and my body heats up,
106.059: the scent naturally rises from my neck.
107.635: I want the scent to spread well,
110.288: so I make sure to spray here too.
112.882: [Next up, CLIO cushion foundation]
I've been using this a lot lately.
115.697: A lot of people around me use this cushion,
119.02: so to make mine stand out,
122.099: I put a sticker on it.
123.793: [My essential glasses]
I brought my glasses too.
127.939: I also brought the glasses my BEBE members gifted me.
132.405: [These are the new glasses I bought this time]
A new pair of glasses!
136.781: I also brought my charger.
138.559: [My signature sticker is on this too]
I put a sticker on this as well.
141.881: Me and Ari.
145.0: But right now, I'm starving,
147.336: so I’m heading to the convenience store.
149.871: I'll turn the camera back on after I get back.
152.912: I’m back from the convenience store.
155.573: This is seriously so good, guys.
157.337: [Choco Monaka Jumbo!]
158.931: The outer layer isn’t soggy bread,
161.712: but super crispy.
163.729: It’s really delicious. Inside,
165.8: there's a dense Ghana chocolate filling.
167.751: That kind of chocolate, it's so good!
170.65: [Chomp!]
172.581: [Official convenience store haul briefing time]
Let’s go through what I bought at the convenience store.
178.294: First, my favorite.
180.251: Jelly!
181.921: I've introduced this many times before.
183.523: This is the Hi-Chew Premium.
185.664: It’s not super chewy,
187.653: but soft like cotton candy.
188.778: It kind of melts in your mouth.
191.279: It's really good.
192.455: I always buy at least ten packs of this.
196.342: [My favorite flavor is grape, highly recommended!]
It's so good.
197.811: This one is also my favorite, it’s a bit chewier.
201.172: [Fettuccine Gummi Cola flavor]
Cola is my favorite flavor.
203.144: You don’t find many cola-flavored gummies in Korea.
205.223: But this one? The cola flavor is the real deal!
208.306: And a snack I bought for the first time today.
210.729: [Onigiri Senbei]
It looked like a seaweed-flavored snack, so I wanted to try it.
213.142: I was craving something slightly salty and sweet.
215.635: This too!
216.402: [IkaSomen]
217.441: I learned about this squid snack thanks to Tatter.
219.678: It's shredded like thin noodles.
222.115: Tatter and I both love squid.
225.121: This looks like mochi.
226.925: [Yuki Ichigo!]
Strawberry mochi?
228.643: My Favorite Ramen!
230.573: [Donbei Kitsune Udon]
Tada!
232.623: I tried this before, and it was so good.
235.113: I’ll eat quickly, take a shower, and go to bed.
238.275: I have to go to the practice room tomorrow,
242.072: and I think there are things I need to refine after today's monitoring.
247.217: I’ll do my best!
251.237: [That’s it for today!]
Bye!
254.351: [Final practice done, now some free time in the evening!]
258.063: [Taking a taxi]
260.408: [Tap tap tap]
264.488: [Safely arrived]
So right now,
265.971: I'm at the shopping street in Fukuoka!
270.335: It wasn’t that cold when I arrived,
274.081: but now that I'm walking, it's a bit chilly.
277.37: [Finally, Don Quijote across the street!]
281.304: [There were too many people in Don Quijote, so I couldn’t film inside]
283.922: [Next stop is]
288.602: [Arrived at Canal City]
292.263: For dinner, I had tendon.
294.263: I just randomly (walked) into a place,
296.337: and it turned out to be a tendon restaurant.
298.214: [Satisfied]
299.292: It was super delicious!
302.456: [Waiting to cross the street]
305.572: [There was a huge fountain show inside Canal City]
308.903: [Time to admire the view]
315.987: [It was massive and so flashy... Amazing]
318.741: [After that, I went for crepes]
321.05: This one is strawberry ice cream.
324.575: And this one is a chocolate, banana, and strawberry crepe.
329.818: I got both!
331.098: Since I’m greedy, I’m eating both.
334.181: Because the one with ice cream is delicious,
336.706: and so is the chocolate-banana one.
339.141: That’s why I got both.
341.23: I’ll just sit anywhere and start eating.
344.476: [So excited]
346.723: [Trying the strawberry ice cream crepe first!]
349.553: [Why is it so hard to focus the camera?]
358.325: This combo can’t be bad!
360.299: So delicious!
362.117: [The strawberries are tangy, and the ice cream is sweet, a guaranteed win!]
364.958: I feel like I always eat crepes when I come to Japan.
370.3: This crepe is super chewy.
374.796: [There’s also a really good crepe place in front of Mangwon Station]
377.529: [I’ll introduce that place to you all next time]
379.313: [Gotta take a proof shot]
382.3: [Nom nom]
385.376: [It’s cold, so I need to take a taxi back quickly]
389.401: [Second convenience store haul briefing]
Time for today’s convenience store haul.
394.149: I really love konjac.
396.08: [Convenience store oden packed with konjac (but I didn’t buy the oden itself)]
Like this.
399.632: [Excited]
Looks like it’s going to be so good.
401.234: [Radish, cucumber, and carrot]
I bought these as side dishes to eat with my ramen.
405.787: [Can’t forget my love, Hi-Chew]
My lover, I bought this flavor to try.
410.034: Did I only buy this flavor?
411.561: [(No way)]
Of course, I got this one too!
413.947: Obviously! (You all know me, right?)
415.791: [Not Yesterday, Beware!]
Not yesterday, but today!
417.633: Guys, this is seriously good!
420.539: [Nagewa Uma Shio]
I had this last tie I came to Japan.
423.17: It’s like a mini version of onion rings,
425.367: but with a firmer texture.
426.927: It’s not crispy like onion rings, but more dense.
430.737: It’s really tasty!
431.664: [Highly recommended!]
Recommended!
433.578: I actually brought Gan Jjamppong from Korea.
437.012: But to be honest, that Gan Jjamppong is...
438.778: [The instant Gan Jjamppong that never made it out of my suitcase]
It had been sitting in my suitcase for over three months.
443.459: Finally, I’m eating it today!
444.713: I've never tried instant Gan Jjamppong before.
447.272: Let’s give it a try.
449.416: [Gotta start with the konjac oden first]
This is the konjac I bought earlier.
451.628: I absolutely love konjac noodles.
453.906: But look at the size of this one?!
456.567: [I can’t resist this]
It’s amazing.
458.855: [Nom nom]
461.802: It’s delicious.
462.997: I wish they sold this in Korea too.
469.773: [This is it]
So good, so good.
472.454: You know those round oden cups from convenience stores?
477.958: They only put like one single piece of konjac in there!
480.419: I used to save it for the last bite.
482.535: [My precious konjac]
I would always keep it for the end.
484.321: But now, I can eat as much as I want!
488.281: [Time to eat the cucumber side dish too]
Guys,
490.139: do you like cucumbers?
492.178: I love dipping fresh cucumbers in ssamjang.
495.533: [Preparing to eat instant Gan Jjamppong for the first time]
I’ll cook it and be right back.
499.442: It’s a stir-fried noodle type.
509.981: Wow, it's really spicy.
511.912: [Turns out, I accidentally bought the one that’s 4 times spicier than regular jjampong]
I must have picked the extra spicy one.
515.357: It’s even spicier than Buldak Ramen?!
517.66: [The kind of spiciness that makes you sweat]
521.74: [Cooling down with iced tea]
524.265: It’s not just spicy, it’s deliciously spicy,
527.273: so I keep eating it.
529.18: But it's too spicy.
531.1: Neutralizing the heat with konjac.
533.212: Just looking at it makes me sweat.
534.495: It's right in front of me,
536.613: [And every time I look at it, I facepalm]
I keep staring at it...
540.117: [Shaking my head]
541.599: [Pulling myself together]
Tomorrow is finally the Golden Disc Grand Prize...
545.4: Grand Prize?
547.106: [Brain malfunctioning]
548.697: [Take 2]
Tomorrow is finally the Golden Disc Awards.
552.551: It’s the official day, right?
555.847: Let’s try again!
557.089: [Focus, focus]
558.368: [Take 3]
Tomorrow is finally Golden Disc Day 1,
562.115: Deep breath...
562.73: No, no, that’s not what I meant to say!
565.088: [The spiciness is still hitting hard]
567.188: Tomorrow is finally Golden Disc Day 1!
571.131: It’s the debut stage for ‘CLOSE YOUR EYES,’
575.943: and I’m here as their director.
579.144: I’ll do my best as a director as well.
584.813: I’ll try to capture some moments tomorrow too.
589.723: See you all tomorrow, bye!
596.571: [Sneaking around behind my performing babies]
599.208: [I’m feeling so nervous and emotional]
601.377: My babies did such an amazing job on their debut stage.
606.014: Even while filming their performance, I got super emotional.
609.753: [We’ve been training together since last summer through PROJECT 7]
I tried so hard to hold back my tears, but still...
613.702: [Since we’ve laughed and cried together, it feels even more overwhelming and proud]
I’m just so relieved that they wrapped it up so well.
617.946: Bada, you’re the best!
618.758: [Haein, who worked hard with me!]
Bada is the best, Bada is the best!
621.214: You worked so hard, yet you’re still smiling at the end,
623.917: I really think you’re incredible.
625.927: I don’t think I could live like Bada does.
628.74: She’s truly amazing.
629.871: GOD-BADA, living the ultimate productive life.
631.484: [You’re the best too, Haein]
632.493: [And today’s main stars, CLOSE YOUR EYES!]
635.437: It’s overrrrr!
638.01: [CLOSE YOUR EYES just finished their nerve-wracking debut stage]
I can’t believe I’m in Bada’s vlog!
640.42: Can we get a greeting?
641.833: [Perfectly in sync and adorable]
Yes.
643.07: We’ll introduce ourselves!
644.052: Two, three!
644.782: Hello, we are CLOSE YOUR EYES!
647.152: Please support us!
648.843: [When did they grow up so much?]
