48.809: [Recognized #1 Dancer Visuals]

72.468: [Did a proper research]
Hello, Residents.
74.532: - We are...
- Kwon Twins!
76.74: [(Scattering instantly)]
77.886: [Is this the family's business mode...?]
This is my first time seeing you guys do this.
80.601: Could you introduce yourselves one by one?
82.922: Hello! I'm Deukie from Kwon Twins.
85.266: [The older brother by 3 minutes]
I am the older brother.
86.596: I am... truly grateful to get to visit
89.664: "Practice Room's Bada Lee".
91.431: [(Extreme pressure)]
- I'm so nervous, I could die.
- It's nerve-wracking.
93.536: Hello! I'm the cute younger brother
95.477: [(Found the camera!)]
96.726: [The younger brother by 3 minutes]
among the Kwon Twins.
98.522: I'm the cutie, Dony.
99.7: Recently, you worked on choreography
103.228: [(Auto-generated)]
- for G-Dragon, right?
- Oh, you startled me.
104.49: Whoa, that surprised me.
105.428: [POWER Concentration / (Me too)]
Oh, you startled me.
107.247: [(Extreme INFP) / (Extreme ENFJ)]
I’m an introvert...
108.806: Recently, I worked on Jaehyun’s choreography with Bada.
111.696: So we’ve danced together before.
113.406: Actually, it was the first time
114.875: [First time meeting on stage]
- we performed on the same stage, right?
- That’s right.
117.94: Before that, there was Taemin’s "Sexy in The Air"!
121.827: [Kwon Twins - Inkigayo] / [Bada - M Countdown]
- But... we couldn’t perform with you at the time.
- That’s true...
124.58: The timing didn’t work out.
125.919: [We can dance it now]
128.811: Can you see the clear difference?
130.479: [The distance between us is growing...]
- Oh, you’re here?
- Ah, it’s hot...
131.885: It's okay, take it easy.
133.619: In November, I worked with Miss Bada again...
136.16: [Filming took place in early November / Everybody's watched the 2024 MAMA, right?]
for the MAMA stage.
137.763: [ENHYPEN’s stage confirmed as well]
I had another important performance too.
140.944: I was afraid it would be overwhelming
142.463: to handle both stages.
144.1: [That’s when Bada started making her request]
But Bada suddenly requested to join.
146.306: I own every single G-Dragon solo and concert album!
151.208: [Turns out she's a VIP]
"When else would I get a chance to do this?" is what I thought!
154.455: [That’s how Bada joined the legendary stage]
I’ve been such a long-time fan...
159.24: You're dressed so beautifully today!
161.374: I dressed like this
162.342: [(Grabbing everyone’s hearts)]
because I think your subscribers would like it.
165.563: [(You like it, right?)]
Thank you.
166.756: [Practice room OOTD]
Practice room OOTD is also important!
168.221: Honestly, this is... fake, you know?
170.275: You don’t dress like this in the practice room.
172.061: [Exposed]
You’re always wearing that bandana!
174.357: Uh... that’s true, but...
176.325: when my outfit isn’t great
178.162: I tend to lack...
179.473: Do you know what I mean?
180.671: Coming on "Practice Room's Bada Lee,"
182.865: I felt like I should really...
184.429: [(Fact)]
try to look cool?
185.49: [(Correct)]
I tried to look cool!
187.853: [Okay...]
188.991: [Today, I’m a fake]
Wow, you're doing great. Amazing.
190.842: [Heartless younger sibling]
He always shows off like this...
192.657: [Cold sweat dripping]
Shall we switch places?
194.194: [(Pressured)]
- But that’s more...
- Better, right?
195.83: But you look adorable today!
197.977: An all-time adorable vibe?
199.639: [Today’s cute look]
I don’t usually dress like this.
202.531: But I bought this not long ago, so...
204.035: [Brand new knitwear]
205.344: I usually wear black plain tees...?
208.551: T-shirts like that.
211.328: But today
212.458: I'm wearing colorful clothes
214.511: [(Oh my god)]
just to meet Bada.
219.528: Oh, you're doing great.
220.694: So, now...
222.22: [What are Kwon Twins' essential items for the practice room?]
- Please reveal your essential items for the practice room!
- Sure!
224.918: I regret that
226.932: I forgot to bring one item
229.388: [The true essentials, left crying at home]
that is absolutely essential...
231.934: [The true item's identity will be revealed shortly]
I kept telling the writer about it.
233.049: The writer said to me...
234.83: [(It got seriously concerning...)]
"Are you doing an ad...?"
236.062: It'd be so good if we were advertising it!
237.948: But actually, it’s the first time I’ve seen
239.574: the two of you with bags.
241.622: You usually just casually go, "Oh, hey, Bada!"
243.465: [Shall I erase my memory?]
One, two, three!
245.0: [(No one will know, right?)]
Starting with Dony!
246.559: [Dony's essential item]
First of all...
248.221: this one!
250.097: [Dony's practice room essentials / Muscle tape]
Taping!
251.172: - Of course, we need it.
- You know this, right?
252.347: [Constant companion for muscle pain]
Dancers have a lot of joint problems...
255.872: This is the first time this has appeared!
257.065: Bada is very good at giving reactions.
259.029: It makes you feel like talking is worth it.
260.482: This is how you do it! YouTube, man!
262.828: YouTube needs to be like this, man!
265.24: [Dony's practice room essentials / Pro YouTuber's camera]
YouTube needs...!
267.143: Hello, this is Dony from Kwon Twins!
270.371: [Dony's practice room essentials / Pro YouTuber's camera / (I have one too)]
274.446: I really didn’t mention this to him.
276.199: - Earphones.
- Oh, so cute!
277.513: [Dony's practice room essentials / AirPods (with "Street Man Fighter" sticker)]
- Oh, what’s this?
- This is...
279.219: - Is it merchandise?
- This sticker...
280.881: After I stuck this on, the choreography turned out amazing!
283.166: Oh, there’s also this!
284.816: [Dony's practice room essentials / Bandana collection]
- Here it is.
- For real...
287.068: [Dony's practice room essentials / Bandana collection]
Finally, it's something I've seen before!
288.596: [Usual bandana styling]
I usually wear a bandana.
291.462: We sweat a lot.
293.081: When they practice
295.17: with only one turn
296.213: [Swoosh / Swoosh]
their sweat will fly off.
297.624: [The Kwon Twins spray water in the practice room]
Their sweat will fly everywhere.
299.858: Do you really carry these many around?
301.465: [(Looks like a lot even from a quick glance)]
Yes, I always have these many.
303.589: [Dony's practice room essentials / Choreography notebook]
Also, there's a notebook.
304.841: - I'm the type to memorize choreography.
- Do you write everything down?
306.997: [Handwriting full of memories]
Yes, I wrote them all.
307.914: Can I
308.76: take a look at this? I found this really cool.
312.043: [Full of Dony's effort]
You wrote the lyrics beside the dance formation.
315.212: What is this?
316.818: Ah, this is my perfume!
317.962: [Dony's practice room essentials / A trendy perfume accessory]
Oh, is this a perfume?
319.827: [(Sniifs)]
Yes.
320.928: This is totally your scent!
322.223: Okay, now
323.14: [Deukie time! / (Pressured)]
- it's Deukie's time!
- Do it well.
324.849: [Self-cam introduced earlier]
Okay, confidently.
325.853: [The struggles of a YouTuber]
But isn't it hard to do all this?
327.339: But it's really
328.491: [(Too hard)]
- too hard.
- Isn't it too hard?
329.536: If we're filming ourselves like this
330.954: and then someone comes by, we hide the camera like this.
332.136: [Evidence: Youtube "KwonTwins"]
333.835: It's the same with Dony earlier.
335.941: [Deukie's practice room essentials / Kwon Twins' signature perfume]
- Perfume!
- That's right.
337.679: [Different personalities, same preferences]
We didn't tell each other about this
339.91: - but we brought the same thing.
- So it's the real essential item, huh?
341.525: Also this.
342.929: This is the best!
344.941: [Deukie's practice room essentials / Portable mini massager]
- Is that for massage?
- That's right!
346.123: There's even a mini version?
347.588: This was a gift from fans.
350.039: As dancers, we're used to having our muscles strain, right?
352.398: [A bit of a sad item]
When that happens, I use this to relax my body.
355.749: [New dream item discovered]
I didn't know that they have the mini version too!
357.207: Also, I use this too.
359.092: [Deukie's practice room essentials /
Choreography notebook (Different writing style from Dony's)]
360.243: But the difference between me and Dony is
362.123: - You jot down things that only you can understand!
- I write down whatever comes to mind!
363.64: Like this.
365.101: [Deukie's writing style]
I did all of them like this.
369.1: This one is a real essential.
370.472: [Deukie's practice room essentials / Energy booster ginseng / (Passing)]
I was about to share this.
372.829: [(Passing)]
Really? Thank you.
374.664: [Cheers with ginseng]
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
375.868: He drinks this so fast.
377.634: [The predictable one]
Don't you have the last essential item?
380.947: [(Doesn't know)]
382.055: [Oh, that one?]
Ah, of course, I brought it.
384.682: - The most important thing!
- Of course, the most important thing!
386.848: One, two, three!
388.134: [(Sike)]
You first!
388.801: [Starting with Deukie's profile]
Here you go.
390.307: What should we do?
392.014: [(Used to it)]
- It's okay.
- Are you okay?
393.721: [Dony's most essential item revealed!]
- What's the one you didn't bring today?
- It's arginine.
396.561: [Health is the top priority]
I take that before I work out
398.301: or when I practice since it gives me a lot of energy.
400.498: Deukie's practice room profile.
402.496: Ta-da!
403.665: [Uncannily identical]
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!
405.4: [Q. Nickname in the practice room?]
Practice room nickname, Youngdeukie!
408.179: That's right, I love my name so much.
410.197: [Full name: Kwon Youngdeuk]
My full name is Kwon Youngdeuk
412.226: and it sounds so classic!
413.663: - Youngdeukie!
- Right, I love it!
415.149: [(Plenty of nicknames possible)]
Deukie Deukie Mandeukie.
416.294: [Q. Special dance point?]
My own special dance point.
418.962: Manly and powerful.
421.289: - Raw krumping without formal training.
- Krump.
424.458: And your strength, among your flirting techniques
426.179: I heard it's your biceps.
428.618: I really acknowledge that.
430.205: [(Super biceps)]
I didn't plan on it
432.743: but since I regularly work out
435.02: [A physique that's too good to waste]
and since I need to use my arms
436.629: that's why I do krumping without formal training.
438.427: The other influence is
440.858: [During "Street Man Fighter" battle]
we battled with Prime Kingz a lot.
442.997: [(Became close through the battles)]
And we became close with them.
445.008: Since I like manly and powerful things
447.795: [Started to learn a new genre]
so I started to explore krumping without any guidance.
451.627: [Arm-related memories resurface]
I recently worked with you for Jaehyun's "Smoke" MV.
455.396: [Jaehyun's "Smoke" MV]
- Even the outfit was sleeveless.
- That's right.
458.434: I was next to him
459.943: standing still like this
461.443: but his arm was pumped up next to me!
463.656: Wow, bulk up!
465.65: [Bada is covering her arms]
That's why...
467.115: [The arm size difference is striking]
- "Is this okay?"
- "Is it okay for me to be like this?"
469.807: Next! As a dancer
471.546: [Q. What would you steal from your twin brother?]
a thing that you want to steal from your twin
475.552: you wrote down "flair", so you mean Dony's talent?
478.581: You can tell just by looking right now
480.247: [(Ingrained flair)]
that he has a lot of flair.
481.847: Although on stage
483.89: [Deukie with the flair]
I also show off my flair a lot
485.7: but it comes off as more fierce, should I say?
487.758: Also
488.8: I can't do cute things.
490.875: You have to be careful with your words, how come flair and cuteness...
492.856: Let me finish my words.
493.754: [(That's so hard)]
I can't stand it, it's driving me crazy.
495.927: But Dony is good at
497.787: mixing and expressing those two things.
501.037: Sounds good.
502.779: See?
504.094: But I don't really mean to steal it from him.
505.568: [A bit of an ambiguous brotherly love]
507.041: What was that?
508.223: - You like yourself just the way you are?
- That's right.
509.326: [Q. Most favorite choreography]
Your most favorite choreography you've worked on
511.754: - is POWER by G-Dragon!
- That's right.
514.129: He recently made a comeback.
515.707: [GD's song + Kwon Twins' choreography = Hit]
He came back after a long time, so I was happy.
517.679: And that's become my favorite choreography.
519.504: You spent your youth
522.029: [The brilliant youth of Kwon Brothers]
- together with him.
- Exactly!
524.347: We joined YG in 2009.
527.143: And our first concert was
528.977: [G-Dragon's first solo concert with Kwon Twins]
his solo concert, "Shine A Light"
531.705: [Their first time working together]
so we have a strong bond with him.
536.329: [The reason why "POWER" is his favorite]
And since he came back after a long time...
539.226: [Hidden "POWER" behind story?]
There's actually an interesting story behind this.
541.784: [(Looks like Bada knows this too)]
I heard about it!
544.744: Are we revealing this for the first time?
545.857: A complete exclusive!
546.99: [Revealing the precious behind story]
- The real deal!
- I've heard this!
548.245: It's absolutely exclusive!
550.002: [One-take filming for the "POWER" MV]
Since he filmed the music video in one-take
551.714: I rehearsed it first
553.494: [Did a perfect job as director]
and instructed the dancers to do their thing for the subway scene.
555.837: But when it was time to shoot the subway scene
557.87: [Dancer first, director second]
I had to get in there too.
559.587: And, it was the final take, on top of that!
561.1: [(When everything was perfect...)]
Everyone did so well!
562.202: But suddenly, the A&R staff beside me was like,
564.432: "Hey, Deukie...!"
566.008: - She said "Shouldn't you be going in?"
- Wh- where?
567.85: [The late realization]
Huh?
569.222: I was supposed to be right beside Dony
571.085: [(Dony) / Empty space / (GD)]
- so there was a slight empty space.
- That's right!
574.066: I was happy.
575.219: [Dony was slightly hidden by Deukie]
It's because we overlapped a little bit.
576.909: So I thought he was being considerate of me.
579.208: He didn't come in at all.
580.799: And they happened to pick the last take.
583.311: But then,
584.131: the temperature, the humidity,
585.505: [(Nom nom)]
the speed of the goat eating the grass.
588.62: Kyma looks unsure from the beginning.
590.009: [(Where is Deukie?)]
She was like this.
590.742: [Everyone was questioning where Deukie was]
597.706: All I'm showing is my shoulder so far.
598.956: Okay, then.
600.627: Next.
602.145: Let's look at Dony's practice room profile.
604.491: [(All of a sudden?)]
See, even these practice room profiles...
607.011: Yes.
607.859: - I'm here.
- They show your personalities.
609.092: [(Deukie) (Dony)]
This one seems very calm somehow!
611.153: The answers are written neatly.
613.551: But this one screams "POWER" by G-Dragon.
615.96: [Yes, that's me]
You even drew a heart.
618.828: They show your personalities!
620.334: What is your nickname in the practice room?
622.324: Prince.
623.615: That's why I was sitting like this just now.
625.73: [We need someone to explain the nickname "Prince"]
Who would call you this?
627.471: Look, I mean...
629.083: I love to energize people.
630.843: I asked them to call me Prince
633.097: so they feel comfortable with me.
634.427: Man, I can't justify this. I'm in trouble.
636.443: [Setting the good vibe]
Prince.
637.434: [??]
I love it.
638.23: [(I'll call you Prince from now on)]
Prince.
639.467: Okay, next.
640.401: Your unique dance or flirting technique?
641.972: I gently stare into people's eyes first and then a big smile.
648.244: [Everyone cracked up]
651.471: Oh, no!
653.158: Your ears turned red.
655.436: [It's almost like Dony's entertainment show]
I feel like watching an entertainment show.
657.378: Ain't I amazing?
658.696: What do you want to steal from your twin as a dancer?
662.527: You wrote "power".
665.856: Deukie and I really...
667.429: When I watch the video after a concert...
670.211: I mean...
671.318: You know...
672.148: [Bro, do you get frustrated?]
Do you know why I get frustrated?
674.052: [Power!]
676.268: [(I can pull it off too) / Flair!]
677.899: [Both wearing sleeveless]
679.693: [Come back to the discussion]
When I watch the concert videos!
681.276: Let's say we do this dance move.
683.954: This move.
685.549: Deukie goes
686.48: WHOA!!! WHAM!!!
687.725: [Swinging the arms intimidates people around]
He goes really hard.
689.32: I watched the video and thought
690.191: [Relatively looks like not enough effort]
"Did I not put in enough effort?"
691.935: That power from his arms...
694.456: the power itself is on a different level.
696.867: [Twins complementing each other's power and flair]
He's really amazing.
698.392: You wrote that your favorite choreography is "POWER" by G-Dragon.
702.124: Speaking from people's point of view,
703.793: even the people who don't really know about dance,
706.983: [Somewhat pressured]
it should look super cool to them.
709.588: I almost cried.
710.865: Every night,
712.472: [(Poor you)]
I couldn't fall asleep.
713.578: But I had a great sleep after filming this music video.
715.396: [Since Deukie went missing at the music video stage]
I guess in your case, you had more trouble falling asleep after filming it?
717.201: I'm happy that the music video turned out great.
718.931: No matter what.
719.753: [He was cool with it at first]
I'm the director, so it's not so crazy if I'm not in the video.
721.605: But the music video was released and I'm the only one not in there.
724.148: Literally everyone asked me!
725.219: "I see Dony, but why are you not there?"
727.41: Even the fans.
728.978: "Where is Deukie?"
729.92: "Where is Deukie?"
730.918: Now, it's time for
732.368: Teacher Bada to make an appearance in the practice room.
734.833: When dancers join the show,
737.032: [One and only channel where world-class dancers come together]
we make the choreography together.
738.619: [Are you ready to dance?]
Shall we start?
740.054: [Kwon Twins are ready]
- Great.
- Cool, let's stand up.
743.01: Let's start the class.
747.457: Before we begin the class,
748.808: I want to learn the choreography for "POWER"
750.988: [This was before the practice for MAMA, so she didn't learn the choreography yet!]
that you guys worked on.
753.641: [Let's start the lesson by Deukie and Dony]
- Can I learn the choreography?
- Of course.
754.748: Perfect.
755.398: You begin from
756.853: this side, this side,
758.273: [Begin by shaking the arms all around!]
this side, and this side.
761.158: Right hand.
762.653: Left hand.
764.084: Right hand.
765.264: [Dony's glossary / Stamp / Stepping foot making a sound]
Do a stamp.
766.678: [Arm movement with the rhythm]
One, two, three.
769.334: [Like the previous move]
Do a stamp.
770.557: [(Ctrl+C) / (Ctrl+V) / (Ctrl+C)]
771.837: Next.
772.313: Slide.
773.006: [(Slide) (Slide)]
774.078: [The lesson took less than a minute]
- That should be it.
- Great. I love that.
776.496: I almost went on and on.
777.69: [(Thinking)]
This is cool.
779.192: This move as well.
780.708: Excuse me, Dony.
781.93: [Wrong choreography]
One, two, three, four.
783.784: [Trying it together]
788.229: [(I was right)]
You're wrong.
789.347: [(Watching from the sidelines)]
791.908: [(Techno dance out of confusion)]
792.454: See?
793.017: I was right.
793.661: Don't pick a fight.
795.076: Okay.
795.782: [Checking the details before dancing to the music]
797.907: [The arm move thrice]
802.289: [The reason he does it the opposite way]
Since I'm supposed to move this way.
803.863: [Let me add to my composition]
804.945: - Okay.
- That's good.
806.085: I pick things up fast.
807.721: I learned something from her.
809.576: [Informative show "Practice Room's Bada Lee"]
I learned a lot from you today.
810.718: [Let's try "POWER" together]
Can you please play the song with some time before the hook?
812.517: [Recreating MAMA]
817.613: [She nails it]
820.031: [Here's the chemistry of Kwon Twins]
825.334: [Show what you've got]
Something like this.
826.875: [Issue with the noise in the microphone]
Dancers wouldn't give up on the necklace.
829.102: [(He gave up on the necklace first)]
That's why I took it off earlier.
830.94: [(Same here)]
832.217: [Must-have item in the pocket: Taken off necklace]
It's so funny I have this in the pocket.
835.08: Now we will make the choreography for the challenge.
836.965: [Let's listen to the song first!]
This is the song.
838.616: [They will make the choreography for this song]
841.669: [Getting the vibe of the choreography]
846.313: Let's go with this vibe.
847.711: [step 1. Shake the shoulder in rhythm / Fixing the choreography that they're sure of]
851.008: [step 2. Turn around and move the arm twice]
- Turn around and do something like this.
- Turn around.
854.297: [Anyone got any ideas?]
What else can we do?
857.193: Let's repeat this one more time
858.845: and dance freestyle at different heights.
861.277: Shall we dance to the music?
862.312: [(Zipping up)]
863.38: [(Reading the room)]
864.429: [Worried about the microphone]
It's inaudible if I do this, right?
865.941: [Not missing the chance to tease him]
- What about like this?
- What about this?
869.009: [The same naughty boy from before]
873.718: [The choreography they quickly came up with is amazing]
875.857: [(This is what I'm talking about)]
That's neat.
877.448: [Continues to choreograph]
Let's cross.
879.297: [Bada dances, Kwon Twins show their specialty "Switching Places"!]
- Cool.
- No, you can stay where you are.
881.367: - This is our specialty.
- Is it?
884.716: [Let's review the additional choreography]
888.215: [step 3. Stop for a second and groove with the arms]
891.449: [step 4. Stretch the right leg and lower the body down]
895.035: [step 5. Cross the legs and jump to switch places]
897.971: You guys are amazing. Perfect.
900.538: [This is Kwon Twins]
You get why we are twins, right?
902.849: [Dancing to the music again]
907.731: [(Buzzing)]
909.879: [(Here I go too)]
912.203: [Going on with krumping that he has never formally learned]
914.874: [They get distracted for a moment but come back to choreograph]
916.333: - We'll come forward at this part.
- Sounds good.
920.643: Shall we finish off with a freestyle dance?
923.592: What do you think? Is it too easy?
925.61: [Bada initiated the never-ending development of the choreography]
Bada can start alone first.
929.193: When Bada points with her finger,
931.675: we look at the finger.
932.87: [Adding detail for gaze and order]
935.601: Wow, you guys are really amazing.
938.367: You immediately come up with the composition.
939.471: [Bada also goes on and adds the sequence]
Can we rotate instead of you two crossing?
941.543: I'll go like this first.
942.628: [Getting complicated]
Then each of us rotate in a circle.
947.541: [After switching places]
Here, you dance in the center
949.037: Then Deukie goes first
950.212: after this movement.
951.338: You do this move.
952.455: [Change the starting point of the gaze and nod in rhythm]
955.159: [The choreography for the challenge is almost done]
Then, rotate again.
957.937: [(The production team is amazed by them)]
- Great.
- Okay.
959.958: It's hot.
960.466: Do we look like we dressed too warm?
961.869: You guys come up with the choreography in a snap of a finger.
963.96: [Never miss a chance to tease]
In a snap of a finger.
965.747: - In a snap of a finger.
- All of you are like Bada now!
967.067: [(It's an honor)]
968.058: Snap, snap.
968.97: Snap, snap.
969.653: [Stop it]
972.863: [Are you the same people who were joking around just now?]
980.827: What do you think?
981.959: It's great.
982.922: [Perfectly Bada's cup of tea]
- Do you like it?
- I'm having so much fun.
984.216: [Found something to change while reviewing]
There's one more thing to develop.
987.828: [Why don't we go back to the initial one]
Why don't you do this move?
990.313: [Of course I can if Bada asks!]
995.572: [And suddenly a dance party]
999.221: [Starting the challenge with excitement]
I'm getting energized.
1000.317: [Wearing the necklace again]
Wow, this is the first time for us three to dance together.
1004.052: [You are watching these three do a dance challenge for the first time]
1010.633: [You three should dance together every day]
1013.855: I love the choreography.
1015.289: [Can't resist grooving while monitoring]
1018.849: - Wow, I love it.
- It's nice.
1022.258: Did you see that?
1023.224: This is Ba-Deuk-Don.
1024.618: [Find the full version of the Ba-Deuk-Don challenge on YouTube Shorts!]
- Ba-Deuk-Don sounds good.
- Ba-Deuk-Don.
1029.531: "Practice Room's Bada Lee"
1032.519: [(Wait a minute)]
Look at my hair.
1034.148: Each half of my hair is each one of your hair color.
1036.009: [Deukie with hair down, Dony with hair up]
This is Deukie.
1036.733: - This is Dony.

How shall we wrap it off?
1065.423: [Let's sing "Bada" instead of "POWER"]
"Bada. Bada, Bada. Bada, Bada."
1068.118: [Amazing closing on top of amazing choreography]
That's good.
