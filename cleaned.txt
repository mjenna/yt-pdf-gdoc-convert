- I couldn't sleep well last night. I came without sleeping. Where did you learn to say this kind of comment? Then. Thank you. Thank you. Hello, Badali residents. This is Practice Rooms Bada Lee. This is Bada! This place that I came first. It is. It is HYBE! It is my first time coming here for filming. So I am very excited. To give you a little hint about today's guest. XO XO Everyone knows, right? Let's go meet them right away. Let's go! How long has it been since we last filmed in the practice room? It is really our first time filming a dance content. Where is it? Is it here? Where is it? Is it there? I heard they are right here in this practice room. I will head right in. There is the menu. There is the restaurant. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Fourth generation performance kings! We have ENHYPEN's HEESEUNG, NI-KI. Thank you for coming. I am the one who came. Please say hello to our subscribers. Yes, we will say hello. One, two. CONNECT! Hello, we are ENHYPEN! Yes. Greeting just by two of us. It is really awkward. Really? Today. I am actually looking forward to today. Are you looking forward to today's lesson too? We are really looking forward to it. Very much. We have our excited heart. I couldn't sleep well last night. I came without sleeping. It was at five o'clock. I think you are lying. Really. Because I was told that I was meeting ENHYPEN. I came dressed like XO's outfit. Does it look alike? It is quite similar. I think you have some vibes. Okay, okay. It's my first time being in this practice room. Our practice room is on the third floor. But the air conditioner is broken. HYBE's air conditioner might be broken. Please fix it. Please fix it. Actually we have never worked together. That is right. But you have done the Smoke challenge. That is right. Did you watch it? Of course! I watch everything. Oh my gosh. In order for us to get closer. Could we start with Smoke challenge? Could we do it with just counts. That is right. You know it all. But I watched the video. So it goes backwards because you memorize it as you watched. I memorized it as I saw it. That is okay. Then. Let's talk sitting down, shall we? That is good. Okay, I will sit down. Oh my gosh. If you come to Practice Rooms Bada Lee, you have to tell us what is must-have item in your practice room. They really introduce us really must-have items. I must bring this! Do you guys have that kind of items? Mine is perfume. Perfume. Originally, after practicing, even though I sweat a lot, I couldn't feel that it was uncomfortable. But when I am going home after it is all finished, I feel a bit icky. When I'm not feeling so good, I try to use the perfume and I try to hide it and then take a shower. I also carry around perfume a lot. I always spray it before practice. I spray it during practice. That is right. That way it is a bit. I can practice a lot fragrantly. For me, it's a cap. It took about four months for this to arrive. I had it customized in the United States. It is a customized cap. It is really precious. I always use it when I am practicing. Always. My hair is a bit long, so it's very uncomfortable. You just brush your hair back and put it on right away. I also love hip-hop dance. It might be your first time seeing this. Do you know what this is? What is this? It is iced tea. Really? I always drink it whenever I practice. Is it peach iced tea or lemon iced tea? It is peach. It is peach. Really, I went to all the places around this company. I think I tried all of their iced tea. It's a hoodie. This hoodie is really. Do you like hoodies? I can't dance if I am not wearing a hoodie. Really? I buy three or four hoodies of the same design. And I would rotate them. Wearing a hat and a hoodie. Then, do you have more must-have items? That is it. That is it? Really? There must be something else. Thank you! I spray it like this. Then we got our practice room profile. So we will take a look at the profile. We will take time to figure out. HEESEUNG's practice room profile. His practice room name. It is SUPREME HEESEUNG. Since elementary school, I haven't heard this word. The ZI. That is right. I am ZI SUPREME HEESEUNG. That is right. I also like popping. It is a bit Y2K vibe. I heard about this. HEESEUNG originally couldn't dance well. I heard, at first. When I came here at first as a trainee, I have never danced before. So I had a bad habit. I was very flexible and things. So they said I looked like a squid. To the point where I would get teased... So I got stimulated by those things a lot. There was YEONJOON from TXT. I got stimulated and since then, I practiced a lot. He was a good stimulation. Yes. Is he really the legendary trainee? Yes, he is. Then the next generation was me. Wow. That's right. From what I heard, there is YEONJOON among the Big Hit trainees, but there is also HEESEUNG. That is right. Then what was your first dance in your life? He really wrote his first dance in his life. The dance when I was in kindergarten. I had curly hair. I wore an outfit like disco. We were doing some moves like this. They said I used to be really good back then. I was one of the most talented. You had a lot of talent. Yeah talent... Well then is there a really unforgettable dance choreography that you still remember? I remember our debut song. Liar. We practiced our debut song, which we hadn't performed in a long time. Nobody could remember the dance. There's a plot twist. We're doing well so far, why are you doing that? My special dance move is dancing along with my hair. Kind of... How shall I say it? Dancing together with it? Like this? For example, we have a dance move for our song 'Fatal Trouble'. Like this. It's this kind of feeling. You really dance with your hair! Like this and kind of like this. That's the special dance point! HEESEUNG's. Point. It's your point. Next. This is information about Ni-ki. It's kind of like Y2K over here. Nickname for practice room. What is there? To SUNOO. Hello? I have to make a nickname. Hm... (serious) You're helping me. Then how about... Something like Dance Machine or Choreography Genius. You said Dance Machine. Dance Machine. It seems like you dance like a machine. When I practice dancing, there are times when we need to dance in the opposite direction, right? 'You turn around and teach the other members the dance moves.' Like this I am told to do this. The information is received quickly. You dance right away. You have been dancing since you were 3 years old. My parents really loved Michael Jackson. I saw the 'Thriller' music video. I fell in love with Michael Jackson. So 'Billie Jean' was your first dance ever. It was Michael Jackson's 'Billie Jean'. Wow it's really on another level. While HEESEUNG was doing this disco disco dance, you danced 'Billie Jean'. Then my special dance move is utilizing my neck. It's similar to HEESEUNG. When I perform in our concert, the end is so different from the beginning. When I slick my hair back, I end up with bangs covering my forehead. Since I use my neck too much, my hair gets messed up. Have you ever sprained your neck while dancing? No, it's surprising that it hasn't happened. Really? So my neck is really thick. It�s something you're born with. Is it all muscles here? And when I buy necklaces, they become chokers. Since my neck is so thick. My favorite choreography that I made. 'HUMBLE' by Artist of the Month. How was it while you were preparing for this? While I was preparing, since I was representing ENHYPEN, Exactly. I felt a lot of pressure. But I think it was really fun. NI-KI's image as a part of ENHYPEN and NI-KI's image as an individual was completely separate, so I was able to have a lot of fun while doing it. I heard that all seven of you dance well. I really like that dance move. This one. 'Pass the MIC.' 'Future Perfect' Yes, and I even saved it offline and watched it over and over on the airplane. I was like, 'How do they do those dance moves?' I studied it a lot. You watched a lot of our performances. Then what was the hardest dance? One of the first songs, performing cute songs was the most difficult. I also can't do cutesy things. Shouldn't we ask him to do it here? But even after several years, it's still so difficult. / (Taken aback)] Really... Watching the most difficult choreography of ENHYPEN. Well you two have practiced together for a long time. Right. Could you rate each other's dance? I think NI-KI's greatest strength is that. Even though he didn't put in all his power, he looks very powerful. And he's groovy. He is able to show this through songs that have swag. He is like that when performing those songs. Now if you could rate HEESEUNG's dance? I feel this during concerts. He is able to express his own style so well. So HEESEUNG seems to have his own genre. So I envy that about him. Where did you learn how to talk like that? I�m really serious, seriously. Touched. HEESEUNG and NI-KI both seem to have strong personalities. Both of you have positive energy and spread it. Then. So now that we have information about you, shall we start our lesson? Okay. Okay! Let's go. Shall we officially start the class? Okay, let's go. Okay! ENHYPEN's new song is coming out. Please introduce it. The song 'No Doubt' is about undoubted love for the other person. There's a lot of interesting moves in the dance. There's an old school feel to it. Old school. Shall we learn the challenge? Do you have back pockets? Um...ye...yes... I do. They're a little lower. This time it's the special move. Five, six, seven eight and do this with your head this way. Two... Two. Three and four. And four. Just do it like that. Five, six, seven and move your head -eight, end. End. Two, three, and four and roll. It's kind of like feeling. Feeling, feeling. It's good. That's right. At five, this way. Five. Six, seven, eight. Eight. With a whistle. One, eat it, two, three, and four and five. Five, six, seven, and eight. Is it right? (Checking) Kung kung tta. Tta da da da. That's right. Okay. Let's try it once more and move on. He's really good at teaching. You're like a teacher. I know! One, two. One. Three, four. Five, six. Five, six. Seven and... Seven and... Eight. Eight. That's all. This part using the shoulder is hard. Kung kung kung kung. Up. Deun deun deun deun. Up. How is this up? Okay. Okay! She did it in one go. Then you two will step out. Almost do it, but decide not. Okay. It's amazing. Do you like it? I do. Good, thank you. One shot, one kill. Teacher NI-KI and HEESEUNG, thank you so much. Just slightly I'll teach you the Rodeo choreography. Of course I know. You're going to first wear a belt. The very famous dance... Right foot, left foot. Bring your shoulder, and punch. That's right. Then do the wave from your lips, hold your pants, and move to the side. Deureureuk! Deureureuk! Chik chik chik. Chik chik chik. That's it, whatever you want. This is not supposed to be a real class. Please do some talking. Okay. It's me in a real practice room. I'm taking a class. Stab, take out. Clap, bring them back. Dereuk deuk. And then base. You're really good! The best HEESEUNG and dance machine. Let's move on to the next part. Head, collarbone and turn. Your leg should... That's right! Come back, and zero gravity. Keep doing the laid-back and then go over. Pull an oar, and shake your head twice. Think like you have a stick in your hand. One, two, three. Nice, bam and come back. Bam, and come back. Let's do it from the beginning and then play the song. One, two, eight, eight, eight. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Space out, and then go. That's right. Level of difficulty? Ten out of ten. I'm happy. I feel like I'm back in my trainee years. There's another one. You're dancing so intensely. HEESEUNG and NI-KI dance even better if you see them in person. NI-KI is good with the swag moves from the inside and with HEESEUNG I understand why his coolness is a genre. You used your neck so well! Should we try once more? Yeah. Are you okay? I am. How do you like "Practice Room's Bada Lee"? Wow... It's the best. That was a real response. Let's go! I stepped out like this. Thank you! I taught them well. This is your first time on "Practice Room's Bada Lee." How was it today? First of all, thank you so much for coming here. I really like the dance I learned from you. So I tried really hard. Thank you! What about you, NI-KI? It was so much fun. I feel like I came to a workshop. I'll really wrap myself around and go to your workshop next time. Or I can come here after I'm all tied up. I had a great time. Then can you decide the ending? What about this? That's good. Like this. Practice Room's Bada Lee. Bade Lee. Let's go out like this. Practice Room's Bada Lee. Bade Lee. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, I'll go this way. Goodbye. This way... Thank you so much!
