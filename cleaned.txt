Transcript for Video 1 ================================================== Mom, how do I make doenjang jjigae? Wait, time. I might turn into a hexagon person again. Hello, everyone. It's Bada. This is my new home! Since I started living on my own for the first time I was thinking about what new content I can show you and I came up with cooking which I always wanted to show you! I wanted to do a cooking vlog so today, I'm going to cook some delicious food. But the PDs don't trust my cooking. So I will prepare some feast to win over their hearts. Today's menu is doenjang jjigae, omelet rice, and spring onion kimchi. When I in fourth grade, I wanted to cook for myself so I was like 'Mom, how do I make Doenjangjjigae?' So I made my first doenjang jjigae in fourth grade. So, to bring back those memories, I'll be cooking doenjang jjigae! This is my first time in this new home so I'm not sure if I'll be able to show off my skills but I'll try my best. Let me slice up some ingredients. I like to have mushrooms in doenjang jjigae. I even bought this to cook. This is enoki mushroom and it's really good. My mother would always put this when she was cooking jjigae. And it was so good. Let's just cute them in bite-sized pieces. You're good at cutting. It's a little... showing off. Cutting to show off! I'm done with cutting the ingredients for doenjang jjigae. I'm done. Let me boil the water. Let's pour water as much as I want and let me put in the mushroom first. You will fall in love with this mushroom. It's really good. (Whispers) Enpine mushrooms? (Whispers) Enleki mushrooms! Enoki! I think the pot is too small. I think it'll boil in no time so I'll put everything in. Cooking Queen Bada Lee Content. On my way here, I watched PAIK JONG WON YouTube and he said traditional doenjang is better when cooking doenjang jjigae. So I bought some traditional doenjang. Put this doenjang... It should be by intuition. I'll put some more of chili powder. Do you think you'll cook often living alone? My mother said that once you buy the ingredients, you must use it up. You must consume all the ingredients. You must! That's kind of like the mindset of our household. You can go in as well. Wait, time. Look how perfect this is. And then... They're very even, aren't they? It's gotten a little smaller now. But it's okay. This is scary. Every time I put something in, I'm like I do this every time. Jjigae taste better the longer they simmer. Let's let them simmer while I make omelet rice. This is ham for kimbap, everybody. It's all cut and you cut just cut them horizontally. They're stuck together. What I was afraid of when starting the cooking content is that there are a lot of people who are good at cooking. So I was worried to get scolded. 'You can't cook that way!' I was afraid of that but everyone has their own styles of cooking. I'll cook in my own style. There's a lot of people so I'll put a lot in! The most important thing is to beat the eggs in advance. Can you open the eggs with only one hand? How do I do it. I've got all the eggshells in here. I'll just do this. You have to sing while you're cooking. I have to stir-fry ham and onions first. Can you pick your best later on? Should I continue with this content? You can decide on that. You guys (subscribers) have to judge as well. I think they're cooked nice so I'll put some rice in. What are you worried about the most when living alone? I'm worried mostly about the house chores. When I live with my family, we can share the work but now I have to do them all by myself. House chores are the hardest to do. Have you ever thought about the nickname for your subscribers? I want to do something special. How about river? River? Rivers come together to make a sea (Bada). Rivers come together to meet the sea. Or mountain? Hey, Mountains! I never knew I could actually cook in this house. I think this is going not too bad. I like sausages so I've prepared some sausages. Do you see my expert skill? Which one? If you grill them all together like this, it won't burn and it'll grill on the sides as well. They are well cooked. I'll fry the egg now. Actually, I wanted to do the tornado omelet or something like that. But instead, I'll be a little calm and do what I'm used to do. When it's about this much cooked, I'll put the stir-fried rice in. You need to film this well! I might turn into a hexagonal person again. You're octagonal. Heart. That looks pretty. Donkatsu sauce inside the heart. Full of love. This is the vibe I'm looking for. Hexagonal! Lastly, I'll try the spring onion kimchi. I have to cut through the middle like this. A spoonful of crushed garlic. Put some soy sauce in. At my home, it's easier to make this because my mom always keeps the kimchi sauce ready made. I can just use that. The secret to kimchi was my mom's sauce. It's not that bad to eat though. Completed. Now, I'll share these with the PDs to have a taste. I'm nervous. Bon appetit. Enjoy. It's so good. Really? I would pay for this. Try it. I'll have a spoon of omelet rice. Omelet rice tastes good...! It's really good. Really. It's good. I was wondering what you were bringing. It's so good. Applaud! The spring onion kimchi, finally. It's not that good. Right. It's really not good. They all look puzzled. It's gone wrong. But it's spicy. Chili powder and spring onions are meant to be spicy. It's like a little refresh. You've just become a pentagon. I've been subtracted one from hexagon. From Hama PD, what's your favorite? Omelet rice, full of love! It felt like the rice wasn't ready-cooked. Doenjang jjigae. Doenjang jjigae is your favorite? This is intense. The smell of it spikes up the expectations and it tastes so deep. Omelet Rice. It looked easy but still fancy. Right. Your choice will decide which is the first and which is the second. Which menu was the best? Doenjang jjigae. It's a tie! This one took off the 0.5 points, right? Doing the dishes, rock paper scissors. Rock paper scissors. Three games? Rock paper scissors. Okay. Rock paper scissors. Three games. I only have to win two more game. Rock paper scissors. Last game. Rock paper scissors. Rock paper scissors. Thank you for the meal. I was going to do the dishes anyway, but it was to make this more fun. I'll take off the rings. I'll do the dishes then. This is part of my content as well. ================================================== Transcript for Video 2 ================================================== Great job, everyone! Bye. Hello, everyone! Today. Where am I on a business trip? I'm here in Fukuoka for work! For 'PROJECT 7,' which will be performing at the 'GOLDEN DISC AWARDS.' Our 'CLOSE YOUR EYES' team, who officially made their debut! They're performing the choreography I created at the 'GOLDEN DISC AWARDS' this time, so I'm here to direct their stage. I helped with rehearsals, monitored their performance, and gave feedback. After handling a few things, I just got back to my hotel. Coming as a director... Is this my first time directing abroad? I've done it so many times in Korea, but I'm still a bit nervous and doing my best with a strong sense of responsibility. Shall I organize my bag a bit? First, I bought a perfume. New perfume. I forgot to bring my perfume. So I got this pebble-shaped perfume. This is the scent I got. I used to only use solid perfumes, but I wanted something more portable, so I got this one. Since it�s a scent I�ve used before, of course, it smells amazing. Here's how I apply my perfume. I spray it like this, quick spritzes all over. Then, I spray it on my wrists. I rub my wrists together and spread the scent onto the back of my hands. Then, I do a quick spritz on my clothes. And that�s about it. But my signature move when applying perfume is... Spritzing generously and always spraying on the back of my neck. When it gets hot and my body heats up, the scent naturally rises from my neck. I want the scent to spread well, so I make sure to spray here too. I've been using this a lot lately. A lot of people around me use this cushion, so to make mine stand out, I put a sticker on it. I brought my glasses too. I also brought the glasses my BEBE members gifted me. A new pair of glasses! I also brought my charger. I put a sticker on this as well. Me and Ari. But right now, I'm starving, so I�m heading to the convenience store. I'll turn the camera back on after I get back. I�m back from the convenience store. This is seriously so good, guys. The outer layer isn�t soggy bread, but super crispy. It�s really delicious. Inside, there's a dense Ghana chocolate filling. That kind of chocolate, it's so good! Let�s go through what I bought at the convenience store. First, my favorite. Jelly! I've introduced this many times before. This is the Hi-Chew Premium. It�s not super chewy, but soft like cotton candy. It kind of melts in your mouth. It's really good. I always buy at least ten packs of this. It's so good. This one is also my favorite, it�s a bit chewier. Cola is my favorite flavor. You don�t find many cola-flavored gummies in Korea. But this one? The cola flavor is the real deal! And a snack I bought for the first time today. It looked like a seaweed-flavored snack, so I wanted to try it. I was craving something slightly salty and sweet. This too! I learned about this squid snack thanks to Tatter. It's shredded like thin noodles. Tatter and I both love squid. This looks like mochi. Strawberry mochi? My Favorite Ramen! Tada! I tried this before, and it was so good. I�ll eat quickly, take a shower, and go to bed. I have to go to the practice room tomorrow, and I think there are things I need to refine after today's monitoring. I�ll do my best! Bye! So right now, I'm at the shopping street in Fukuoka! It wasn�t that cold when I arrived, but now that I'm walking, it's a bit chilly. For dinner, I had tendon. I just randomly (walked) into a place, and it turned out to be a tendon restaurant. It was super delicious! This one is strawberry ice cream. And this one is a chocolate, banana, and strawberry crepe. I got both! Since I�m greedy, I�m eating both. Because the one with ice cream is delicious, and so is the chocolate-banana one. That�s why I got both. I�ll just sit anywhere and start eating. This combo can�t be bad! So delicious! I feel like I always eat crepes when I come to Japan. This crepe is super chewy. Time for today�s convenience store haul. I really love konjac. Like this. Looks like it�s going to be so good. I bought these as side dishes to eat with my ramen. My lover, I bought this flavor to try. Did I only buy this flavor? Of course, I got this one too! Obviously! (You all know me, right?) Not yesterday, but today! Guys, this is seriously good! I had this last tie I came to Japan. It�s like a mini version of onion rings, but with a firmer texture. It�s not crispy like onion rings, but more dense. It�s really tasty! Recommended! I actually brought Gan Jjamppong from Korea. But to be honest, that Gan Jjamppong is... It had been sitting in my suitcase for over three months. Finally, I�m eating it today! I've never tried instant Gan Jjamppong before. Let�s give it a try. This is the konjac I bought earlier. I absolutely love konjac noodles. But look at the size of this one?! It�s amazing. It�s delicious. I wish they sold this in Korea too. So good, so good. You know those round oden cups from convenience stores? They only put like one single piece of konjac in there! I used to save it for the last bite. I would always keep it for the end. But now, I can eat as much as I want! Guys, do you like cucumbers? I love dipping fresh cucumbers in ssamjang. I�ll cook it and be right back. It�s a stir-fried noodle type. Wow, it's really spicy. I must have picked the extra spicy one. It�s even spicier than Buldak Ramen?! It�s not just spicy, it�s deliciously spicy, so I keep eating it. But it's too spicy. Neutralizing the heat with konjac. Just looking at it makes me sweat. It's right in front of me, I keep staring at it... Tomorrow is finally the Golden Disc Grand Prize... Grand Prize? Tomorrow is finally the Golden Disc Awards. It�s the official day, right? Let�s try again! Tomorrow is finally Golden Disc Day 1, Deep breath... No, no, that�s not what I meant to say! Tomorrow is finally Golden Disc Day 1! It�s the debut stage for �CLOSE YOUR EYES,� and I�m here as their director. I�ll do my best as a director as well. I�ll try to capture some moments tomorrow too. See you all tomorrow, bye! My babies did such an amazing job on their debut stage. Even while filming their performance, I got super emotional. I tried so hard to hold back my tears, but still... I�m just so relieved that they wrapped it up so well. Bada, you�re the best! Bada is the best, Bada is the best! You worked so hard, yet you�re still smiling at the end, I really think you�re incredible. I don�t think I could live like Bada does. She�s truly amazing. GOD-BADA, living the ultimate productive life. It�s overrrrr! I can�t believe I�m in Bada�s vlog! Can we get a greeting? Yes. We�ll introduce ourselves! Two, three! Hello, we are CLOSE YOUR EYES! Please support us! How was your performance today? Thanks to Bada, we were able to do really well. Please take lots of love from CLOSE YOUR EYES. Great job, everyone! Thank you for your hard work! Bye! ==================================================
