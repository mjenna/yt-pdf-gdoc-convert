Transcript for Video 1 Oh, you're here? Ah, it's so hot... It's okay, take it easy. Honestly, this is... fake, you know? One, two, three! Camera, roll! Okay... I'm sorry... Hello, everyone! I'm Bada, and this is "Practice Room's Bada Lee". Huh? Today's guests are like one, but also two. Two who are one and the same. I'll give you a hint. Shoo, shoo Everyone, do you get it? Let's invite them. Please come out! Excuse me... Where are you going? Our subscribers... Do you know the nickname for our subscribers? Hello, Residents. We are... Kwon Twins! This is my first time seeing you guys do this. Could you introduce yourselves one by one? Hello! I'm Deukie from Kwon Twins. I am the older brother. I am... truly grateful to get to visit "Practice Room's Bada Lee". I'm so nervous, I could die. It's nerve-wracking. Hello! I'm the cute younger brother among the Kwon Twins. I'm the cutie, Dony. Recently, you worked on choreography for G-Dragon, right? Oh, you startled me. Whoa, that surprised me. Oh, you startled me. I�m an introvert... Recently, I worked on Jaehyun�s choreography with Bada. So we�ve danced together before. Actually, it was the first time we performed on the same stage, right? That�s right. Before that, there was Taemin�s "Sexy in The Air"! / But... we couldn�t perform with you at the time. That�s true... The timing didn�t work out. Can you see the clear difference? Oh, you�re here? Ah, it�s hot... It's okay, take it easy. In November, I worked with Miss Bada again... for the MAMA stage. I had another important performance too. I was afraid it would be overwhelming to handle both stages. But Bada suddenly requested to join. I own every single G-Dragon solo and concert album! "When else would I get a chance to do this?" is what I thought! I�ve been such a long-time fan... You're dressed so beautifully today! I dressed like this because I think your subscribers would like it. Thank you. Practice room OOTD is also important! Honestly, this is... fake, you know? You don�t dress like this in the practice room. You�re always wearing that bandana! Uh... that�s true, but... when my outfit isn�t great I tend to lack... Do you know what I mean? Coming on "Practice Room's Bada Lee," I felt like I should really... try to look cool? I tried to look cool! Wow, you're doing great. Amazing. He always shows off like this... Shall we switch places? But that�s more... Better, right? But you look adorable today! An all-time adorable vibe? I don�t usually dress like this. But I bought this not long ago, so... I usually wear black plain tees...? T-shirts like that. But today I'm wearing colorful clothes just to meet Bada. Oh, you're doing great. So, now... Please reveal your essential items for the practice room! Sure! I regret that I forgot to bring one item that is absolutely essential... I kept telling the writer about it. The writer said to me... "Are you doing an ad...?" It'd be so good if we were advertising it! But actually, it�s the first time I�ve seen the two of you with bags. You usually just casually go, "Oh, hey, Bada!" One, two, three! Starting with Dony! First of all... this one! Taping! Of course, we need it. You know this, right? Dancers have a lot of joint problems... This is the first time this has appeared! Bada is very good at giving reactions. It makes you feel like talking is worth it. This is how you do it! YouTube, man! YouTube needs to be like this, man! YouTube needs...! Hello, this is Dony from Kwon Twins! I really didn�t mention this to him. Earphones. Oh, so cute! Oh, what�s this? This is... Is it merchandise? This sticker... After I stuck this on, the choreography turned out amazing! Oh, there�s also this! Here it is. For real... Finally, it's something I've seen before! I usually wear a bandana. We sweat a lot. When they practice with only one turn their sweat will fly off. Their sweat will fly everywhere. Do you really carry these many around? Yes, I always have these many. Also, there's a notebook. I'm the type to memorize choreography. Do you write everything down? Yes, I wrote them all. Can I take a look at this? I found this really cool. You wrote the lyrics beside the dance formation. What is this? Ah, this is my perfume! Oh, is this a perfume? Yes. This is totally your scent! Okay, now it's Deukie's time! Do it well. Okay, confidently. But isn't it hard to do all this? But it's really too hard. Isn't it too hard? If we're filming ourselves like this and then someone comes by, we hide the camera like this. It's the same with Dony earlier. Perfume! That's right. We didn't tell each other about this but we brought the same thing. So it's the real essential item, huh? Also this. This is the best! Is that for massage? That's right! There's even a mini version? This was a gift from fans. As dancers, we're used to having our muscles strain, right? When that happens, I use this to relax my body. I didn't know that they have the mini version too! Also, I use this too. [Deukie's practice room essentials / Choreography notebook (Different writing style from Dony's)] But the difference between me and Dony is You jot down things that only you can understand! I write down whatever comes to mind! Like this. I did all of them like this. This one is a real essential. I was about to share this. Really? Thank you. Cheers! Cheers! He drinks this so fast. Don't you have the last essential item? Ah, of course, I brought it. The most important thing! Of course, the most important thing! One, two, three! You first! Here you go. What should we do? It's okay. Are you okay? What's the one you didn't bring today? It's arginine. I take that before I work out or when I practice since it gives me a lot of energy. Deukie's practice room profile. Ta-da! Ta-da! Ta-da! Practice room nickname, Youngdeukie! That's right, I love my name so much. My full name is Kwon Youngdeuk and it sounds so classic! Youngdeukie! Right, I love it! Deukie Deukie Mandeukie. My own special dance point. Manly and powerful. Raw krumping without formal training. Krump. And your strength, among your flirting techniques I heard it's your biceps. I really acknowledge that. I didn't plan on it but since I regularly work out and since I need to use my arms that's why I do krumping without formal training. The other influence is we battled with Prime Kingz a lot. And we became close with them. Since I like manly and powerful things so I started to explore krumping without any guidance. I recently worked with you for Jaehyun's "Smoke" MV. Even the outfit was sleeveless. That's right. I was next to him standing still like this but his arm was pumped up next to me! Wow, bulk up! That's why... "Is this okay?" "Is it okay for me to be like this?" Next! As a dancer a thing that you want to steal from your twin you wrote down "flair", so you mean Dony's talent? You can tell just by looking right now that he has a lot of flair. Although on stage I also show off my flair a lot but it comes off as more fierce, should I say? Also I can't do cute things. You have to be careful with your words, how come flair and cuteness... Let me finish my words. I can't stand it, it's driving me crazy. But Dony is good at mixing and expressing those two things. Sounds good. See? But I don't really mean to steal it from him. What was that? You like yourself just the way you are? That's right. Your most favorite choreography you've worked on is POWER by G-Dragon! That's right. He recently made a comeback. He came back after a long time, so I was happy. And that's become my favorite choreography. You spent your youth together with him. Exactly! We joined YG in 2009. And our first concert was his solo concert, "Shine A Light" so we have a strong bond with him. And since he came back after a long time... There's actually an interesting story behind this. I heard about it! Are we revealing this for the first time? A complete exclusive! The real deal! I've heard this! It's absolutely exclusive! Since he filmed the music video in one-take I rehearsed it first and instructed the dancers to do their thing for the subway scene. But when it was time to shoot the subway scene I had to get in there too. And, it was the final take, on top of that! Everyone did so well! But suddenly, the A&R staff beside me was like, "Hey, Deukie...!" She said "Shouldn't you be going in?" Wh- where? Huh? I was supposed to be right beside Dony so there was a slight empty space. That's right! I was happy. It's because we overlapped a little bit. So I thought he was being considerate of me. He didn't come in at all. And they happened to pick the last take. But then, the temperature, the humidity, the speed of the goat eating the grass. Kyma looks unsure from the beginning. She was like this. All I'm showing is my shoulder so far. Okay, then. Next. Let's look at Dony's practice room profile. See, even these practice room profiles... Yes. I'm here. They show your personalities. This one seems very calm somehow! The answers are written neatly. But this one screams "POWER" by G-Dragon. You even drew a heart. They show your personalities! What is your nickname in the practice room? Prince. That's why I was sitting like this just now. Who would call you this? Look, I mean... I love to energize people. I asked them to call me Prince so they feel comfortable with me. Man, I can't justify this. I'm in trouble. Prince. I love it. Prince. Okay, next. Your unique dance or flirting technique? I gently stare into people's eyes first and then a big smile. Oh, no! Your ears turned red. I feel like watching an entertainment show. Ain't I amazing? What do you want to steal from your twin as a dancer? You wrote "power". Deukie and I really... When I watch the video after a concert... I mean... You know... Do you know why I get frustrated? When I watch the concert videos! Let's say we do this dance move. This move. Deukie goes WHOA!!! WHAM!!! He goes really hard. I watched the video and thought "Did I not put in enough effort?" That power from his arms... the power itself is on a different level. He's really amazing. You wrote that your favorite choreography is "POWER" by G-Dragon. Speaking from people's point of view, even the people who don't really know about dance, it should look super cool to them. I almost cried. Every night, I couldn't fall asleep. But I had a great sleep after filming this music video. I guess in your case, you had more trouble falling asleep after filming it? I'm happy that the music video turned out great. No matter what. I'm the director, so it's not so crazy if I'm not in the video. But the music video was released and I'm the only one not in there. Literally everyone asked me! "I see Dony, but why are you not there?" Even the fans. "Where is Deukie?" "Where is Deukie?" Now, it's time for Teacher Bada to make an appearance in the practice room. When dancers join the show, we make the choreography together. Shall we start? Great. Cool, let's stand up. Let's start the class. Before we begin the class, I want to learn the choreography for "POWER" that you guys worked on. Can I learn the choreography? Of course. Perfect. You begin from this side, this side, this side, and this side. Right hand. Left hand. Right hand. Do a stamp. One, two, three. Do a stamp. Next. Slide. That should be it. Great. I love that. I almost went on and on. This is cool. This move as well. Excuse me, Dony. One, two, three, four. You're wrong. See? I was right. Don't pick a fight. Okay. Since I'm supposed to move this way. Okay. That's good. I pick things up fast. I learned something from her. I learned a lot from you today. Can you please play the song with some time before the hook? Something like this. Dancers wouldn't give up on the necklace. That's why I took it off earlier. It's so funny I have this in the pocket. Now we will make the choreography for the challenge. This is the song. Let's go with this vibe. Turn around and do something like this. Turn around. What else can we do? Let's repeat this one more time and dance freestyle at different heights. Shall we dance to the music? It's inaudible if I do this, right? What about like this? What about this? That's neat. Let's cross. Cool. No, you can stay where you are. This is our specialty. Is it? You guys are amazing. Perfect. You get why we are twins, right? We'll come forward at this part. Sounds good. Shall we finish off with a freestyle dance? What do you think? Is it too easy? Bada can start alone first. When Bada points with her finger, we look at the finger. Wow, you guys are really amazing. You immediately come up with the composition. Can we rotate instead of you two crossing? I'll go like this first. Then each of us rotate in a circle. Here, you dance in the center Then Deukie goes first after this movement. You do this move. Then, rotate again. Great. Okay. It's hot. Do we look like we dressed too warm? You guys come up with the choreography in a snap of a finger. In a snap of a finger. In a snap of a finger. All of you are like Bada now! Snap, snap. Snap, snap. What do you think? It's great. Do you like it? I'm having so much fun. There's one more thing to develop. Why don't you do this move? I'm getting energized. Wow, this is the first time for us three to dance together. I love the choreography. Wow, I love it. It's nice. Did you see that? This is Ba-Deuk-Don. Ba-Deuk-Don sounds good. Ba-Deuk-Don. "Practice Room's Bada Lee" Look at my hair. Each half of my hair is each one of your hair color. This is Deukie. This is Dony. Okay, move along. Okay.
