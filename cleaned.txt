[Get to know Bada]
Mom, how do I make doenjang jjigae?
Wait, time.
I might turn into a hexagon person again.
Hello, everyone.
It's Bada.
[An unfamiliar place...?]
This is my
[(Congrats) Bada's first independance]
new home!
Since I started living on my own for the first time
I was thinking about what new content I can show you
and I came up with cooking which I always wanted to show you!
I wanted to do a cooking vlog
so today,
[Various ingredients are ready]
I'm going to cook some delicious food.
But the PDs
don't trust my cooking.
So I will prepare some feast
to win over their hearts.
[That's why team Bada was invited without a notice...]
[Confirming Bada's cooking starts]
Today's menu is
doenjang jjigae, omelet rice, and spring onion kimchi.
When I in fourth grade,
I wanted to cook for myself
so I was like 'Mom, how do I make Doenjangjjigae?'
So I made my first doenjang jjigae
in fourth grade.
So, to bring back those memories,
I'll be cooking doenjang jjigae!
This is my first time in this new home
so I'm not sure if I'll be able to show off my skills
[Let's cook]
but I'll try my best.
[Before cooking, wash your hands]
Let me slice up some ingredients.
I like to have mushrooms
in doenjang jjigae.
I even bought this to cook.
[Purchased organizing bowl for a tidy cooking experience]
This is enoki mushroom
and it's really good.
My mother would always put this
when she was cooking jjigae.
And it was so good.
Let's just cute them in bite-sized pieces.
You're good at cutting.
It's a little...
showing off.
Cutting to show off!
I'm done with cutting the ingredients for doenjang jjigae.
[Ingredients for doenjang jjigae / Mushroom, zucchini, onions all cut]
I'm done.
Let me boil the water.
Let's pour water as much as I want
and let me put in the mushroom first.
You will fall in love with this mushroom.
It's really good.
(Whispers) Enpine mushrooms?
(Whispers) Enleki mushrooms!
Enoki!
I think the pot is too small.
I think it'll boil in no time
so I'll put everything in.
[You look like a cook...]
Cooking Queen Bada Lee Content.
On my way here,
I watched PAIK JONG WON YouTube
[Mr. Paik's tip: Cook doenjang jjigae with traditional doenjang!]
and he said traditional doenjang is better
when cooking doenjang jjigae.
So I bought some traditional doenjang.
Put this doenjang...
It should be by intuition.
I'll put some more of chili powder.
Do you think you'll cook often living alone?
My mother said that
once you buy the ingredients, you must use it up.
You must consume all the ingredients.
You must!
That's kind of like
[All the remaining ingredients from today will be used up]
the mindset of our household.
[All the ingredients were cooked in hygienic environment]
You can go in as well.
Wait, time.
Look how perfect this is.
[Very evenly cut]
And then...
They're very even, aren't they?
It's gotten
[It went a little bit off]
a little smaller now.
But it's okay.
This is scary.
Every time I put something in, I'm like
[Making a fuss]
[Soup cooking essentials]
I do this every time.
Jjigae taste better the longer they simmer.
Let's let them simmer
while I make omelet rice.
This is ham for kimbap, everybody.
It's all cut
and you cut just cut them horizontally.
[Differs depending on the product...]
They're stuck together.
What I was afraid of when starting the cooking content
is that there are a lot of people who are good at cooking.
So I was worried to get scolded.
'You can't cook that way!'
I was afraid of that
but everyone
has their own styles of cooking.
[Going the Bada style...!]
I'll cook in my own style.
There's a lot of people so I'll put a lot in!
The most important thing is to beat the eggs in advance.
Can you open the eggs with only one hand?
[Trying]
How do I do it.
I've got all the eggshells in here.
I'll just do this.
You have to sing while you're cooking.
[Ham, onions, shrimp / Stir-fry the ingredients in the order]
I have to stir-fry ham and onions first.
Can you pick
your best later on?
[The future of this content is destined]
Should I continue with this content?
You can decide on that.
You guys (subscribers) have to judge as well.
[When it's well cooked, stir-fry them with rice]
I think they're cooked nice so I'll put some rice in.
What are you worried about the most when living alone?
I'm worried mostly about the house chores.
When I live with my family, we can share the work
but now I have to do them all by myself.
[Every person living alone will relate...]
House chores are the hardest to do.
Have you ever thought about the nickname for your subscribers?
I want to do something special.
How about river?
River?
Rivers come together to make a sea (Bada).
Rivers come together to meet the sea.
Or mountain?
Hey, Mountains!
I never knew I could actually cook in this house.
I think this is going not too bad.
I like sausages so
[Adding her favorite, sausages]
I've prepared some sausages.
Do you see my expert skill?
Which one?
If you grill them all together like this,
[Bada's tip: Keep the oil and sausages on one side to grill]
it won't burn and it'll grill on the sides as well.
They are well cooked.
[Last hurdle, frying the egg]
I'll fry the egg now.
Actually,
I wanted to do the tornado omelet or something like that.
But instead, I'll be a little calm
and do what I'm
used to do.
When it's about this much cooked,
I'll put the stir-fried rice in.
You need to film this well!
[Perfect]
[Hexagonal person BADA LEE]
I might turn into a hexagonal person again.
You're octagonal.
[Octagonal person who even sprinkles the sauce well]
[Another one is a heart decoration]
Heart.
That looks pretty.
Donkatsu sauce inside the heart.
[Falling down]
Full of love.
[This is Lucky-Vicky!]
This is the vibe I'm looking for.
Hexagonal!
Lastly, I'll try the spring onion kimchi.
I have to cut through the middle like this.
A spoonful of crushed garlic.
[Soy sauce 2 : Anchovy Sauce 1 : Enough Sugar]
Put some soy sauce in.
At my home, it's easier to make this
because my mom always keeps the kimchi sauce ready made.
[Cooking Queen of the day, BADA's sauce / Her house doesn't have mom's sauce]
I can just use that.
[Missing the taste of mother]
The secret to kimchi was my mom's sauce.
It's not that bad to eat though.
Completed.
Now, I'll share these
with the PDs to have a taste.
- I'm nervous.
- Bon appetit.
Enjoy.
[A taste of doenjang jjigae first]
- It's so good.
- Really?
I would pay for this.
Try it.
I'll have a spoon of omelet rice.
[Shocked]
Omelet rice tastes good...!
It's really good.
[Full of compliments]
[(Feeling great) / makes BADA dance]
Really.
It's good.
[Gone out of the camera]
I was wondering what you were bringing.
- It's so good.
- Applaud!
[A little worried about tasting the spring onion kimchi]
The spring onion kimchi, finally.
It's not that good.
Right.
It's really not good.
They all look puzzled.
- It's gone wrong.
- But it's spicy.
Chili powder and spring onions are meant to be spicy.
It's like a little refresh.
You've just become a pentagon.
I've been subtracted one from hexagon.
[End of tasting, time for the examination]
[Nicknames for the examination]
From Hama PD, what's your favorite?
Omelet rice, full of love!
It felt like the rice wasn't ready-cooked.
[Carrot Super PD's Pick!]
Doenjang jjigae.
Doenjang jjigae is your favorite?
This is intense.
The smell of it spikes up the expectations
and it tastes so deep.
[Kong Noodle PD's Pick!]
Omelet Rice.
It looked easy but still fancy.
Right.
Your choice will decide which is the first and which is the second.
Which menu was the best?
[Manager's pick!]
Doenjang jjigae.
It's a tie!
[Spring Onion Kimchi / (Upset)]
[A tied winner Omelet Rice and Doenjang Jjigae]
[They would pay for it and the fancy process for it / Enoki mushrooms are a high recommendation!]
[The third place spring onion kimchi / Spring onion and kimchi]
[Tasters Reviews 4.5 Stars]
[What's the destiny of Bada Lee's Cooking Content?]
This one took off the 0.5 points, right?
Doing the dishes, rock paper scissors.
Rock paper scissors.
[Three games with the manager]
- Three games? Rock paper scissors.
- Okay.
Rock paper scissors.
[Bada wins]
Three games.
I only have to win two more game.
Rock paper scissors.
[Bada 2 wins]
Last game.
Rock paper scissors.
[Bada 2 wins 1 lose]
Rock paper scissors.
[Lost twice in a row]
[At the end]
Thank you for the meal.
I was going to do the dishes anyway, but it was to make this more fun.
I'll take off the rings.
[After the cooking, finished with the dishes as well!]
I'll do the dishes then.
This is part of my content as well.
